# üìä Data & Analytics Architecture Portfolio

This repository showcases reference architectures, design reports, and solution blueprints for modern data & analytics platforms.  
It is designed as a **portfolio of work** that demonstrates how to evaluate, design, and recommend enterprise-scale data solutions.

## üöÄ Contents

### 1. Reports & Presentations
- **[Data Analytics Transformation Report](reports/Data_Analytics_Transformation_Report.docx)** ‚Äì detailed evaluation of three architecture options, roadmap, and recommendations.  
- **[Credera Interview Presentation](reports/Data_Analytics_Transformation_Credera_Presentation.pptx)** ‚Äì a professional presentation of architecture choices and trade-offs.  

### 2. Architecture Options
- **Option 1: Databricks Lakehouse (AWS / Azure / GCP)**  
  Unified BI + Data Science platform, scalable ML/AI support, future-proof, cloud-agnostic.  
- **Option 2: AWS Native Data Analytics**  
  Glue, Redshift/Snowflake, SageMaker. Tight AWS integration, managed services, strong governance.  
- **Option 3: dbt + SaaS Data Warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)**  
  Analytics-first, rapid BI enablement, low overhead, excellent for reporting and self-service.  

### 3. Diagrams
Architecture blueprints & flow diagrams are in [`diagrams/`](diagrams/):  
- Databricks Lakehouse reference diagram  
- AWS Native Analytics reference architecture  
- dbt + Snowflake cloud-native stack  

### 4. Code Samples
Found in [`code-samples/`](code-samples/):  
- Example **Terraform** setup for AWS Redshift & IAM policies.  
- Example **dbt models & tests** for analytics transformations.  
- **Airflow DAG** sample for orchestrating ELT pipelines.  

### 5. Playbooks & Checklists
Practical guides for implementation:  
- [`playbooks/data_governance_checklist.md`](playbooks/data_governance_checklist.md)  
- [`playbooks/mlops_best_practices.md`](playbooks/mlops_best_practices.md)  
- [`playbooks/cloud_migration_roadmap.md`](playbooks/cloud_migration_roadmap.md)

## üìê Guiding Principles (AWS Well-Architected Framework)
All designs are evaluated against the **AWS Well-Architected pillars**:  
- **Operational Excellence** ‚Äì automation, CI/CD, observability.  
- **Security** ‚Äì IAM, encryption, governance.  
- **Reliability** ‚Äì resilient pipelines, multi-AZ, DR.  
- **Performance Efficiency** ‚Äì elastic scaling, optimized workloads.  
- **Cost Optimization** ‚Äì right-sizing, pay-per-use.  
- **Sustainability** ‚Äì long-term adaptability & skill enablement.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. Browse the **reports/** folder for detailed write-ups.  
2. Open the **presentations/** deck for client-ready slides.  
3. Explore **diagrams/** for reference architecture visuals.  
4. Reuse **code-samples/** for infrastructure or transformation patterns.  
5. Apply **playbooks/** in real-world data strategy or migration projects.

## üìå Roadmap (Planned Additions)
- Add sample **CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions for dbt).  
- Expand **Terraform blueprints** for AWS, Azure, GCP.  
- Add **radar chart comparison** for architecture options.  
- Include **sample data governance framework** (metadata, lineage, PII handling).
